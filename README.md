# 🤖 Agentic AI Task - Multi-Agent System using Gemini

This project is part of a learning task assigned by **Sir Hamzah Syed** during our Agentic AI course at GIAIC. The goal was to implement a multi-agent system where a **Manager Agent** assigns a query to multiple role-based agents.

## 🔍 Project Description

The system demonstrates how different AI agents can collaborate and respond to a single task with distinct roles and perspectives using **Google Gemini API**.

### 🧠 Agents Involved:
- **Manager Agent**: Delegates the task and initiates the run.
- **Marketing Agent**: Responds creatively with product appeal in mind.
- **Mobile App Developer Agent**: Provides app-focused insights.
- **Web Developer Agent**: Offers ideas from a web development viewpoint.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **asyncio**
- **Google Gemini (via OpenAI-compatible API)**
- **Custom Agentic AI Framework**


## ✅ What This Project Demonstrates

- Role-based agent instructions
- Multi-agent communication and task distribution
- Real-world use of **asynchronous Python** and **LLM coordination**
- Building blocks of Agentic AI systems

## 🙌 Special Thanks

Grateful to **Sir Hamzah Syed** for the opportunity to learn Agentic AI through practical implementation and teamwork simulation.
